# Data Structures Practicals

This repository contains practical assignments for the Data Structures class at university. Each practical demonstrates key data structure concepts and algorithms implemented in C.

## Folder Structure

- **Practical-1/**
  - `A.C`, `B.C`, `C.C`, `D.C`, `E.C`: C source files for different practical problems.
  - `A.exe`, `B.exe`, `C.exe`, `D.exe`, `E.exe`: Compiled executables for each practical.
  - `Practical1.pdf`, `Practical1.docx`: Documentation and write-up for Practical 1.
  - `3) Index page of Practical file.pdf`: Index or summary page for the practicals.

## How to Use

1. Open any `.C` file to view the source code for a specific practical.
2. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc A.C -o A.exe
   ```
3. Run the executables to see the output:
   ```bash
   ./A.exe
   ```

## Purpose

This repository is intended for learning and practicing fundamental data structures and algorithms, including:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
